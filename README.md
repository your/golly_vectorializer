# Golly Vectorializer

## Description

A [Processing](https://processing.org/) Interactive App to (mainly):

* Import [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/)'s [RLE files](http://golly.sourceforge.net/Help/formats.html#rle) containing [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) (precisely the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life))
* Customize the CA's graphical appearance using a dynamic vector Grid
* Create, draw and export new RLEs
* Export the graphical result ***vectorialized!***

## Main goal

Golly Vectorializer was designed and developed as a support tool for *graphic designers* to work with CA originally created for Golly.

## Functioning

At the moment, Golly Vectorializer can parse and draw on grid the **first generation only** from the provided CA.

Given this static snapshot on grid, through an exhaustive set of controls on app you can customize the generation â€” made of *active* and *inactive* **cells**.

For instance you can crop or add columns/row, and even change the status of each containing cell.

You can also stretch or widen the cells, filling them with colors according to a customizable **palette**, randomly or using a probability distribution function!

## Aknowledgments

Marika Mastrandea and Michele Bozzi are the designers that originally contacted the authors to work togheter on an identity design project for a **[self-sustaining organization](http://www.trackzero.org/)**.

The software delivered exceeded the original requirements and maybe skipped some of them... but, judging from the results, we personally don't regret that. :)
