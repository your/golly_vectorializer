# Golly Vectorializer

## Description

A [Processing](https://processing.org/)  app to (mainly):

* Import [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/)'s
  [RLE files](http://golly.sourceforge.net/Help/formats.html#rle)
  containing
  [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)(CA) 
  (precisely
  [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
  one) and visualize them
* Customize the CA's graphical appearance using a customizable dynamic vector Grid
* Create, draw and export new RLEs
* Export the graphical result ***vectorialized!*** (pdf)

## Main goal

Golly Vectorializer was designed and developed as a support tool enabling
*graphic designers* to work with Golly's CAs in vector graphics. 

## Functioning

At the moment, Golly Vectorializer can parse and draw on grid the
provided CA **first generation only**.

Given this static snapshot on grid, through the app widgets you can customize the generation â€” made of *active* and *inactive* **cells**.

For instance you can crop the viewport, add columns/row, and even change the status of each containing cell.

You can also stretch or widen the cells, filling them with colors
according to a customizable **palette**, randomly or using a
probability distribution function. It is possible to color neighbor
active cells by the same color, according to a notion of proximity.

## Aknowledgments

Special thanks to Marika Mastrandrea and Michele Bozzi who are the
designers that originally contacted the authors to work togheter on an
identity design project for **[TrackZero, a self-sustaining organization](http://www.trackzero.org/)**.

The identity theme naturally felt under topics such as self-organizing
complex systems and artificial life. The main objective was to convey
the idea of a live, bottom-up, holistic structure in a generative design way.

Some of the produced graphical artifacts can be found here, here and
here [links temporary unavailable].

The software delivered exceeded the original requirements and maybe skipped some of them... but, judging from the results, we personally don't regret that. :)
